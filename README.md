# Front End Practice 

The goal of this repository is to practice and improve my skills in design, interactions, animations, responsiveness, troubleshooting, and more by providing a selection of real websites for me to recreate from scratch. Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this hands-on approach allows me to gain a diverse set of valuable skills.
